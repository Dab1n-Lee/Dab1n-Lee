## 👋 About Me

- 🎓 Studying **Piano** at the College of Music, **Yonsei University**
- 🎓 Interdisciplinary major in **Cognitive Science**, minor in **Computer Science**, and **AI Convergence Advanced Major**
- 💼 Worked as a **Backend Developer** at <b>Oz Corporation</b> (1 year)
- 🎶 Trying to connect **music, cognition, and AI** to create new kinds of human-centered experiences

I started from music and cognitive science, fascinated by how ideas from psychology and cognition inspired the early days of AI —  
from simple **MLPs** to **CNNs** and **reinforcement learning**.  
Now I want to build computational models that are inspired by human cognition and use them to create  
unexpected, yet deeply relatable, experiences in **Music AI**.

## 🎶 Music AI & Cognitive Science

I’m especially interested in:

- How **cognitive science & psychology** inspired early AI architectures
- Building models that are **inspired by human cognition** rather than just data
- Using AI to offer **“universal but deeply personal” experiences** that humans might have imagined or felt before
- Designing systems that can **generate or accompany music** in a way that feels expressive, not just mechanical

For me, Music AI is not only about generating notes,  
but about exploring how AI can **extend human experience** through sound.
